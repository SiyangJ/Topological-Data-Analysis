abstract={Characterizing glandular architecture in histology images of adenocarcinomas is a fundamental problem in digital pathology, with important implications for computer-assisted diagnosis and grading. In this paper, we present a new set of features for encoding the glandular epithelium architecture based on two recently developed vectorized persistent homology representations called persistence images and persistence landscapes and demonstrate their application to colorectal cancer diagnosis. On the MICCAI2015 Gland Segmentation Challenge Contest dataset with 165 images (85 training, 80 test images), we obtained a benign vs malignant classification accuracy of 85% and 83% using persistence image and persistence landscape based features, respectively.},

abstract="Persistent homology (PH) is a method used in topological data analysis (TDA) to study qualitative features of data that persist across multiple scales. It is robust to perturbations of input data, independent of dimensions and coordinates, and provides a compact representation of the qualitative features of the input. The computation of PH is an open area with numerous important and fascinating challenges. The field of PH computation is evolving rapidly, and new algorithms and software implementations are being updated and released at a rapid pace. The purposes of our article are to (1) introduce theory and computational methods for PH to a broad range of computational scientists and (2) provide benchmarks of state-of-the-art implementations for the computation of PH. We give a friendly introduction to PH, navigate the pipeline for the computation of PH with an eye towards applications, and use a range of synthetic and real-world data sets to evaluate currently available open-source implementations for the computation of PH. Based on our benchmarking, we indicate which algorithms and implementations are best suited to different types of data sets. In an accompanying tutorial, we provide guidelines for the computation of PH. We make publicly available all scripts that we wrote for the tutorial, and we make available the processed version of the data sets used in the benchmarking.",

abstract="This paper presents a novel automated tumor segmentation approach for Hematoxylin {\&} Eosin stained histology images. The proposed method enhances the segmentation performance by combining the topological and convolution neural network (CNN) features. Our approach is based on 3 steps: (1) construct enhanced persistent homology profiles by using topological features; (2) train a CNN to extract convolutional features; (3) employ a multi-stage ensemble strategy to combine Random Forest regression models. The experimental results demonstrate that proposed method outperforms the conventional CNN.",

pages="301--328",
abstract="We introduce the theory of strong homotopy types of simplicial complexes. Similarly to classical simple homotopy theory, the strong homotopy types can be described by elementary moves. An elementary move in this setting is called a strong collapse and it is a particular kind of simplicial collapse. The advantage of using strong collapses is the existence and uniqueness of cores and their relationship with the nerves of the complexes. From this theory we derive new results for studying simplicial collapsibility with a different point of view. We analyze vertex-transitive simplicial G-actions and prove a particular case of the Evasiveness conjecture for simplicial complexes. Moreover, we reduce the general conjecture to the class of minimal complexes. We also strengthen a result of V. Welker on the barycentric subdivision of collapsible complexes. We obtain this and other results on collapsibility of polyhedra by means of the characterization of the different notions of collapses in terms of finite topological spaces.",

An existing algorithm using simplicial complexes is adapted to the setting of cubical complexes. The proposed approach enables efficient application of persistent homology in domains where the data is naturally given in a cubical form. By avoiding triangulation of the data, we significantly reduce the size of the complex. We also present a data-structure designed to compactly store and quickly manipulate cubical complexes. By means of numerical experiments, we show high speed and memory efficiency of our approach. We compare our framework to other available implementations, showing its superiority. Finally, we report performance on selected 3D and 4D data-sets.",
